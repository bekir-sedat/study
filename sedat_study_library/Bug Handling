Bug Handling
	
	- Test again, make sure its is real bug
	- Ask other friend if he is getting the same bug 
	- If yes, i talk to developer and if he agrees, we discuss about the severity of this bug,
	- I inform my PO and get his response about the priority 
	- then i create the bug issue in Jira and add STEPS to reproduce this bug, 
											  add SCREEN HSOTS
											  add Environmmet and Platform info

											  and assign it to Developer 

	- After developer fix the problem, I retest again. If pass
	- If my tests pass, I mark it as "Ready for PO"
