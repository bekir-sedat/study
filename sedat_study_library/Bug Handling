Bug Handling
	
	- Test again, make sure its is real bug
	- Ask other friend if he is getting the same bug 
	- If he is also getting the same bug, 
				i talk to developer and if he agrees, I get his inputs about the severity of this bug,

	- I inform my PO and get his response about the priority 
	- then i create the bug issue in Jira and add STEPS to reproduce this bug, 
											  add SCREEN HSOTS
											  add severity and priority values 
											  add Environmmet and Platform info

											  and assign it to Developer 


	- After developer fix the problem, I retest again. If pass
	- If my tests pass, I mark it as "Ready for PO"
