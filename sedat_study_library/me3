======================== TALK SLOW AND NICELY ===============

First of all, I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity and I really appreciate your time.

I have been in the IT industry little over 8 years. 

During these years I have worked mainly in Finance and Logistics domains.

I am working as a Senior SDET now. 

As being part of a QA member in my projects, my goal is always to release the highest quality product. 

Through out my career, I have successfully tested web-based applications, client-server type applications and database applications. (break)

I have strong programming skills and I am very good with Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

I've worked with different programming languages in my career and I am very good with Java, Python, C# and SQL.

I am currrenly holding Oracle's OCA and OCP Java 7 certifications.  ------ [ TALK SLOW AND NICELY ]

My most powerful skill is creating Automated testing frameworks from scratch and integrating these frameworks with CI/CD tools. (break)

In My last project, I created an Automated testing framework from scratch using Python and Pytest as well.  (break)
I performed ETL Testing and data comparisons between different DataMart and staging tables. 

I have a strong understanding of SDLC and I am very familiar with Agile Scrum methodology.  (break)

If you let me go over the some major testing tools that I used in my previous projects: 
	I used: 
    	- Selenium Webdriver for UI Automation. (break)

	    - Cucumber and Gherkin Language to implement BDD approach.  (break)

	    - Postman for manual Api testing.   (break)   ,RestAssured and RestSharp for Api autmation   (break)

	    - SQL Developer and TOAD for manual database testing ,  (break) , JDBC and SqlAlchamy libraries for automated database application testing

	    - For performance tests such as load, stress, spike tests as well as scalibilty and reliability tests, I used JMeter

	    - For the unit testing frameworks, I've used:
	    	TestNG, Junit, Xunit and Pytest.	

For CI/CD implementation, I am using Jenkins to run scheduled and triggered test suites.  (break)
Also I used Apache Airflow in my last project to run the scheduled smoke tests. 

For Version Control System, I've been using Git and I have experience with Bitbucket and Github. 


Personally, I really like to learn new things and trying constantly improve my skills with new technologies. 
Also sharing my knowledge with others and helping them makes me really happy. 

If you ask my team-mates about me, they would probably tell that I am a problem solver. I am good at finding a way to solve a problem.(break).


So this is briefly all about me ========================



I am using JIRA for project management and bug tracking.

But, In my latest project, I used Apache Airflow to run automated tests daily from containers. 
because the application was running in Airflow and tests were integrated To run after ETL process is done. 
 There is a "transactions" table, consisting of: transaction ID, character column for customer name, real column for the amount, integer foreign key for the region. There is a regions table, consisting of: region ID primary key, character column for region name What is the SQL query to show the total sales amount for each region?



 Select R.region, SUM(T.amount)  from Transaction T join Region R on T.region = R.region_ID

Modular: The framework should be adaptable to change. 
Reusable – The commonly used methods or utilities should be kept in a common file which is easily accessible to all the scripts. 
Consistent – The test suite should be written in a consistent format by following the coding practices



If I want to give more details about the tools that I use for Aumationn Frameworks

When I need to use Java for testing, 
	I create my testing framework as a Maven project. 
	For UI testing, I use Selenium Webdriver. To implement BDD approach, I use Cucumber and Gherkin language.
	For API testing, I use RestAssured libraries.
	For database testing, I use Java JDBC libraries.

	I used either TestNG or Junit for unit testing frameworks to run and manage tests


When I need to use C#,
 	I create my testing framework as a VisualStudio Xnit or NUnit Test Project
 	I used RestSharp for API testing
 	For UI testing, I use Selenium Webdriver. To implement BDD approach, I use Specflow
 	Selenium and Specflow can be used for UI testing but I didn't need to do UI when i used C#

 	I used xUnit unit testing framweork to run and manage tests


With Python,
	I am doing database testing using sqlalchamy, Pandas, Numpy libraries
	I am using pytest to run and manage the tests
	I haven't performed UI and API testing using Python , but i can quickly learn and implement related libraries with it.


For continuous integration, I work with Jenkins. 

But, In my latest project, I am using Airflow to create scheduled autometed tests. 

For Version Control System, I use Git. 

I am very familier with Agile Scrum Sofrtware development Methodology and very well exposed to all scrum ceremonies. 

Personally, I really like to learn new things and improve my skills. 
Also sharing my knowledge with others and helping them makes me really happy. 

If you ask my team-mates about me, they would probably tell that I am a problem solver. I am good at finding a way to solve a problem.(break).

So this is all about me=========================


I have extensive experience in manual and automated tests.  ????

In my career, I've created Automation frameworks to test UI's , API endpoints and Databases services.




Weakness --> lack of experience on some tools when new --> may be not good

Can you tell me about a difficult work situation and how you overcame it? --> ask me to developed a ui for --> I did it in pygui


so I’d openly communicate that there was a high-stress situation and ask if anyone had the time to pitch in and help troubleshooting
