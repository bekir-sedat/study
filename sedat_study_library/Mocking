Mocking

Test Doubles == Mock Object, Fake Object, Dummy Object, Test Spy, Test Stub

In general people call Test Double as Mock


Test Stub Example:
 Scenaio: Alarm class call Sensor class, checks the value, Fires Alarm if tire pressure goes down below.
 		Alarm.check(). ---> Sensor.get_presure()

 		Alarm has direct reference to Sensor()

 		Test check() method --> inconvenient to use acual tire Sensor

 		Solution: Alarm(sensor = None) init : self.sensor = sensor or Sensor()
 					Now Alarm accect a StubSensor 
 						class StubSensor:
 							def get_presure():
 								return 15


  Instead of creating our own Stud --> we can use Mock framework in unittest framework
  	this way easier to read
  	stub ==~ real object

  		stub_sensor = Mock(Sensor)


 Fake ---> Fake of all class method implementation unlike stub has one method

 	ex: In python. --> File --> use StringIO
 					   Database ---> in memory database
 					   Server   ---> light-weight web server

 					   up fakes may exist somewhere in production and we can use them in our tests 	
  		stub_sensor.get_pressure.return_value = 15
  		alarm = Alarm(stub_sensor)



everything double does completely configurable by the test
