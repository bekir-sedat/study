I am responsible for developing new autmation scripts and maintaining the “Automated testing framework”.

		I perform different types of functional tests like; integration , smoke , regression  and end-to-end testing S
				 also I perform non-functional tests like load testing, stress testing and spike testing.


		I create test scenarios and test cases for the stories that i am assigned.
			Once the user-stories are ready for testing, I execute these test cases and attach the test artifacts to Jira ticket.
			At the end of the sprint, I provide demo if all tests pass.
			If I find a defect, I create a bug issue and track it until it is resolved.

		I am also responsible from smoke test suite. 
			I maintain this suite and I also maintain its CI/CD tool integration. 
			Smoke Test results are sent to team every mornning and if some tests fail,
			I find the root cause and inform the team about the nature of this failure.  


		I also participate in runnning regression suite before each release. 
			I monitor the test executions to see if anything is wrong. 
			I analyse the test result and I provide a pass-fail report. 
			Again, If I find a defect, I create a bug issue and track it until it is fixed.


		Besides these duties, I participate in all scrum meetings.	
		Especially, in Sprint plannings, I make sure the Acceptance criterias of the user stories are clear and test data is availaable.


		As a CROSS FUNCTIONAL team member, I also help other team members. 
			I participate in code reviews. (Break)
			I also review my peers test scenarios and test cases and provide my inputs. 


		These are briefly my roles.
