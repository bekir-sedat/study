3. What is Linux Kernel? Is it legal to edit Linux Kernel?
Linux kernel is aspecialized program that boots and runs at the lowest availabale level on your hardware.
It has the tas of orcahstiating everything that runs on the computer
Linux kernel refers to the low-level system software. It is used to manage resources and provide an interface for user interaction.
Each program has private memeory and everthin. iF IT CRASH, SYSTEM DONT ??? --> i think

Kernal Mode--- > kernel does things (deamon??)
User Mode. --> where user applications run


4. What is LILO?
LILO stands for LInux LOader. LILO is a Linux Boot Loader that loads Linux Operating System into the main memory to begin execution. 

5. What are the basic components of Linux?

		Kernel: It is the core component of the Operating System that manages operations and hardware.
		Shell: Shell is a Linux interpreter which is used to execute commands.
		GUI: GUI stands for Graphical User Interface which is another way for a user to interact with the system. But unlike CLI, GUI consists of Images, Buttons, TextBoxes for interaction.
		System Utilities: These are the software functions that allows the user to manage the computer.
		Application Programs: Software programs or set of functions designed to accomplish a specific task.

6. Which are common the Shells used in Linux?

		bash: Bourne Again Shell is the default for most of the Linux distributions
		ksh: Korn Shell is a high-level programming language shell
		csh: C Shell follows C like syntax and provides spelling correction and Job Control
		zsh: Z Shell provides some unique features such as filename generation, startup files, login/logout watching, closing comments etc.
		fish: Friendly Interactive Shell provides some special features like web-based configuration, auto-suggestions, fully scriptable with clean scripts
7. What is Swap Space?
	Swap Space is the additional spaced used by Linux that temporarily holds concurrently running programs when the RAM does not have enough space to hold the programs. 

25. What is the minimum number of disk partitions required to install Linux?
	The minimum number of partitions required is 2.

	One partition is used as the local file system where all the files are stored. This includes files of the OS, files of applications and services, and files of the user. And the other partition is used as Swap Space which acts as an extended memory for RAM. 


8. What is the difference between BASH and DOS?
	There are 3 main differences between BASH and DOS:
	BASH: case sensitive DOS: not
	BASH: forward slash directory seperator DOS: argument delimiter
	BASH: Follows naming convention: 8 DOS: No naming convention

9. What command would you use to check how much memory is being used by Linux?
	You can use any of the following commands:

			free -m
			vmstat
			top
			htop

10. Explain file permission in Linux.
	There are 3 kinds of permission in Linux:
		r: read; w: write; x: execute.

		Read: Allows a user to open and read the file
		Write: Allows a user to open and modify the file
		Execute: Allows a user to run the file.

can set in two ways: 
	1. Symbolic like below
			$ chmod <target>(+/-/=)<permission> <filename>
			<target> can be u : user; g: group; o: other; a: all
			'+' is used for adding permission
			'-' is used for removing permission
			'=' is used for setting the permission

			ex: $ chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r filename
	2. Absolute --> use octal representation. 
		ex: For example, if you want to set the permission such that the user can read, write, and execute it and members of your group can 	read and execute it, and others may only read it.
			$ chmod 754 filename 
				7 : r,w,x
				5: r,x
				4: r

11. What are inode and process id?
	inode is the unique name given by the operating system to each file. Similarly, process id is the unique id given to each process.
	file's file serial number (inode number)  ex: 233829
	can see from $ ls -i 

13. What is Virtual Desktop?
	Virtual Desktop is a feature that allows users to use the desktop beyond the physical limits of the screen. Basically, Virtual Desktop creates a virtual screen to expand the limitation of the normal screen. 
	There are two ways Virtual Desktop can be implemented:

			Switching Desktops
			Oversized Desktops

15. What are daemons?
	A daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process to provide functions that might not be available in the base Operating System. Daemons are usually used to run services in the background without directly being in control of interactive users. The purpose of Daemons are to handle periodic requests and then forward the requests to appropriate programs for execution. 

16. What are the process states in Linux?

		Ready: The process is created and is ready to run
		Running: The process is being executed
		Blocked or wait: Process is waiting for input from the user
		Terminated or Completed: Process completed execution, or was terminated by the Operating System
		Zombie: Process terminated, but the information still exists in the process table.

17. Explain grep command.
	Grep stands for Global Regular Expression Print. The grep command is used to search for a text in a file by pattern matching based on regular expression.
	Syntax: grep [options] pattern [files]
		    $ grep -c "linux" interview.txt   --> This command will print the count of the word “linux” in the “interview.txt” file.

18. System Call:
A programmer request a service using kernel from system
A system call is a programmatic way a program request a service from kernel
User work with command line utility and GUI while system calls work silently in the background and interfere with kernel to work done
System Calls are very similar to fuction calls which means they accept and work on arguments and return values.
	The only difference is that system  calls enter a kernel while funtion calls cannot

Sytem Call Categories 
		1. Process Control --> process creation, termination   --> fork(), exec(), exit()
		2. File Management --> open(), read(), write(), close()
		3. Device Management -->  ioctl() = Input and Output Control
		4. Information manintenance --> getpid() alarm() sleep()
		5. Communications (interprocess communication) pipe()(message passing)  shmget() (shared memory)  mmap()



18. Explain Process Management System Calls in Linux
	A programmer request a service using kernel from system
	The System Calls to manage the process are:

		fork () : Used to create a new process
		exec() : Execute a new program
		wait() : Wait until the process finishes execution
		exit() : Exit from the process

		And the System Calls used to get Process ID are:

		getpid():- get the unique process id of the process
		getppid():- get the parent process unique id


19. Explain the ‘ls’ command in Linux
	The ls command is used to list the files in a specified directory. The general syntax is:

	$ ls <options> <directory>

		For example, if you want to list all the files in the Example directory, then the command will be as follows:
		$ ls Example/

	There are different options that can be used with the ls command. These options give additional information about the file/ folder. For example:

		-l	 lists long format (shows the permissions of the file)
		-a	 lists all files including hidden files
		-i	 lists files with their inode number
		-s	 lists files with their size
		-S	 lists files with their size and sorts the list by file size
		-t	 sorts the listed files by time and date


20. Explain the redirection operator.
	The redirection operator is used to redirect the output of a particular command as an input to another command or file.

	There are two ways of using this:

		‘>’ overwrites the existing content of the file or creates a new file.

		‘>>’ appends the new content to the end of the file or creates a new file. 

		ex: $ echo "This is new line" > sample.txt    --> 1 line in file
		ex: $ echo "This is new line" >> sample.txt  --> 2 line in file

		can see content of file --> $ cat samlle.txt


21. Why is the tar command used?
	The tar command is used to extract or create an archived file.

	c: create archive, x: extract, v: verbose, f: file

	Suppose you want to extract all the files from the archive named sample.tar.gz, then the command will be:

		$ tar -xvzf sample.tar.gz

	Suppose you want to create an archive of all the files stored in the path /home/linux/, then the command will be:

		$ tar -cvzf filename.tar.gz

22. What is a Latch?
	A Latch is a temporary storage device controlled by timing signal which can either store 0 or 1. A Latch has two stable states (high-output or 1, and low-output or 0) and is mainly used to store state information. A Latch can store one bit of data as long as it is powered on. 

23. What is a Microprocessor?
	A Microprocessor is a device that executes instructions. It is a single-chip device that fetches the instruction from the memory, decodes it and executes it. A Microprocessor can carry out 3 basic functions:

		1. Mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
		2. Move data from one memory location to another
		2.5. Make decisions based on conditions and jump to new different instructions based on the decision. 


24. Explain Regular Expressions and Grep
	Regular Expressions are used to search for data having a particular pattern. Some of the commands used with Regular Patterns are: tr, sed, vi and grep.

	Some of the common symbols used in Regular Expressions are:

			.	  Match any character
			^	  Match the beginning of the String
			$	  Match the end of the String
			*	  Match zero or more characters
			      Represents special characters
			?	  Match exactly one character

			ex : If you want to list the entries that start with the character ‘a’, then the command would be:
						$ cat linux.txt | grep ^a
			ex : If you want to list the entries that start has the character ‘n’, then the command would be:
						$ cat linux.txt | grep n


25. What is the export command used for?
	The export command is used to set and reload the environment variables. For example, if you want to set the Java path, then the command would be:

		There are 5 main Directory Commands in Linux:

		pwd: Displays the path of the present working directory.
		Syntax: $ pwd

		ls: Lists all the files and directories in the present working directory.
		Syntax: $ ls

		cd: Used to change the present working directory.
		Syntax: $ cd <path to new directory>

		mkdir: Creates a new directory

		rmdir: Deletes a directory
		Syntax: $ rmdir <name (and path if required) of directory>



29. less file ---> used to read the contents of a text file one page(one screen) at a time. if file is large it doesn't access the complete file
	head file ---> display first few lines of a file
	tail file ---> display last few lines of a file
	wc file   ---> count number of lines

	cp file1 file2 ---> copy file1 to file2
	mv file1 file2 ---> move (rename) file1 to file2
	rm file1       --->  remove a file
	rmdir directory ---> remove directory
	mkdir directory ---> make a dirtectory




Scenarios:
1. Suppose you want to copy a file named questions.txt from the directory /new/linux to /linux/interview, then the command will be:

			$ cp questions.txt /new/linux /linux/interview

2. How to terminate a running process in Linux?
	Every process has a unique process id. To terminate the process, we first need to find the process id. The ps command will list all the running processes along with the process id. And then we use the kill command to terminate the process.

	ex: $ kill 21283 ---> quits webull rmember

3. How to rename a file in Linux?
	There is no specific command to rename a file in Linux. But you use the copy or move command to rename the file.

		Using the Move command
		$ mv <oldname> <newname>

		or copy first the remove old
		1. $ cp <oldname> <newname>
		2. $ rm <oldname>


4. How to write the output of a command to a file?
		You can use the redirection operator (>) to do this.
		Syntax: $ (command) > (filename)


5. How to see the list of mounted devices on Linux?
		By running the following command:
		$ mount -l


6. How to find where a file is stored in Linux?
		You can use the locate command to find the path to the file.
		Suppose you want to find the locations of a file name sample.txt, then your command would be:
		$ locate sample.txt


7. How to find the difference in two configuration files?
		You can use the diff command for this:

9. How would you create a text file without opening it?
	The touch command can be used to create a text file without opening it. The touch command will create an empty file. The syntax is as follows:
	$ touch <filename>


10. How would you delete a directory in Linux?
		There are two commands that can be used to delete a directory in Linux.

		1	$ rmdir <directory name>

		2	$ rm -rf <directory name>

		Note: The command rm -rf should be used carefully because it will delete all the data without any warnings. 

11. How would you schedule a task in Linux?
		There are two commands to schedule tasks in Linux: cron and at.

		1. <minute> <hour> <day> <month> <weekday> <command>

		Suppose you want to shut down the system at 6 pm today, then the command for this would be:
		2. $ echo "shutdown now" | at -m 18:00

12. Suppose you try to delete a file using the rm command and the deletion fails. What could be the possible reason?
		The path specified to the file or the file name mentioned might be wrong
		The user trying to delete the file might not have permissions to delete the file.



13. How do you look at the contents of a file named sample.z?
		The .z extension means that the file has been compressed. To look at the contents of the compressed file, you can use the zcat command. Example:
				$ zcat sample.z

14. How to copy files to a Floppy Disk safely?
		Follow these steps to copy files to a Floppy Disk safely:

					Mount the floppy disk
					Copy the files
					Unmount the floppy disk
					If you don’t unmount the floppy disk, then the data might become corrupted.
